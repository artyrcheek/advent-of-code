## --- Part Two ---

Your device's communication system is correctly detecting packets, but still isn't working. It looks like it also needs to look for **messages**.

A **start-of-message marker** is just like a start-of-packet marker, except it consists of **14 distinct characters** rather than 4.

Here are the first positions of start-of-message markers for all of the above examples:

* ``mjqjpqmgbljsphdztnvjfqwrcgsmlb``: first marker after character ``19``
* ``bvwbjplbgvbhsrlpgdmjqwftvncz``: first marker after character ``23``
* ``nppdvjthqldpwncqszvftbrmjlhg``: first marker after character ``23``
* ``nznrnfrfntjfmvfwmzdfjlvtqnbhcprsg``: first marker after character ``29``
* ``zcfzfwzzqfrljwzlrfnpqdbhtmscgvjw``: first marker after character ``26``

**How many characters need to be processed before the first start-of-message marker is detected?**
