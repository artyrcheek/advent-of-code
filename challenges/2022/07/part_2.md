## --- Part Two ---

Now, you're ready to choose a directory to delete.

The total disk space available to the filesystem is ``70000000``. To run the update, you need unused space of at least ``30000000``. You need to find a directory you can delete that will **free up enough space** to run the update.

In the example above, the total size of the outermost directory (and thus the total amount of used space) is ``48381165``; this means that the size of the **unused** space must currently be ``21618835``, which isn't quite the ``30000000`` required by the update. Therefore, the update still requires a directory with total size of at least ``8381165`` to be deleted before it can run.

To achieve this, you have the following options:

* Delete directory ``e``, which would increase unused space by ``584``.
* Delete directory ``a``, which would increase unused space by ``94853``.
* Delete directory ``d``, which would increase unused space by ``24933642``.
* Delete directory ``/``, which would increase unused space by ``48381165``.

Directories ``e`` and ``a`` are both too small; deleting them would not free up enough space. However, directories ``d`` and ``/`` are both big enough! Between these, choose the **smallest**: ``d``, increasing unused space by ``24933642``.

Find the smallest directory that, if deleted, would free up enough space on the filesystem to run the update. **What is the total size of that directory?**
