## --- Part Two ---

You're worried you might not ever get your items back. So worried, in fact, that your relief that a monkey's inspection didn't damage an item **no longer causes your worry level to be divided by three**.

Unfortunately, that relief was all that was keeping your worry levels from reaching **ridiculous levels**. You'll need to **find another way to keep your worry levels manageable**.

At this rate, you might be putting up with these monkeys for a **very long time** - possibly **``10000`` rounds**!

With these new rules, you can still figure out the monkey business after 10000 rounds. Using the same example above:

    == After round 1 ==
    Monkey 0 inspected items 2 times.
    Monkey 1 inspected items 4 times.
    Monkey 2 inspected items 3 times.
    Monkey 3 inspected items 6 times.
    
    == After round 20 ==
    Monkey 0 inspected items 99 times.
    Monkey 1 inspected items 97 times.
    Monkey 2 inspected items 8 times.
    Monkey 3 inspected items 103 times.
    
    == After round 1000 ==
    Monkey 0 inspected items 5204 times.
    Monkey 1 inspected items 4792 times.
    Monkey 2 inspected items 199 times.
    Monkey 3 inspected items 5192 times.
    
    == After round 2000 ==
    Monkey 0 inspected items 10419 times.
    Monkey 1 inspected items 9577 times.
    Monkey 2 inspected items 392 times.
    Monkey 3 inspected items 10391 times.
    
    == After round 3000 ==
    Monkey 0 inspected items 15638 times.
    Monkey 1 inspected items 14358 times.
    Monkey 2 inspected items 587 times.
    Monkey 3 inspected items 15593 times.
    
    == After round 4000 ==
    Monkey 0 inspected items 20858 times.
    Monkey 1 inspected items 19138 times.
    Monkey 2 inspected items 780 times.
    Monkey 3 inspected items 20797 times.
    
    == After round 5000 ==
    Monkey 0 inspected items 26075 times.
    Monkey 1 inspected items 23921 times.
    Monkey 2 inspected items 974 times.
    Monkey 3 inspected items 26000 times.
    
    == After round 6000 ==
    Monkey 0 inspected items 31294 times.
    Monkey 1 inspected items 28702 times.
    Monkey 2 inspected items 1165 times.
    Monkey 3 inspected items 31204 times.
    
    == After round 7000 ==
    Monkey 0 inspected items 36508 times.
    Monkey 1 inspected items 33488 times.
    Monkey 2 inspected items 1360 times.
    Monkey 3 inspected items 36400 times.
    
    == After round 8000 ==
    Monkey 0 inspected items 41728 times.
    Monkey 1 inspected items 38268 times.
    Monkey 2 inspected items 1553 times.
    Monkey 3 inspected items 41606 times.
    
    == After round 9000 ==
    Monkey 0 inspected items 46945 times.
    Monkey 1 inspected items 43051 times.
    Monkey 2 inspected items 1746 times.
    Monkey 3 inspected items 46807 times.
    
    == After round 10000 ==Monkey 0 inspected items 52166 times.
    Monkey 1 inspected items 47830 times.
    Monkey 2 inspected items 1938 times.Monkey 3 inspected items 52013 times.

After 10000 rounds, the two most active monkeys inspected items 52166 and 52013 times. Multiplying these together, the level of **monkey business** in this situation is now ``2713310158``.

Worry levels are no longer divided by three after each item is inspected; you'll need to find another way to keep your worry levels manageable. Starting again from the initial state in your puzzle input, **what is the level of monkey business after 10000 rounds?**
